   <br>
   <p style="text-align: center;">Hi! I'm Duke!</p>
   <p style="text-align: center;">I like to code for no apparent reason</p>
   <br>
   <p>You may have found me from my <a href="https://twitter.com/dukeatron200", id="link">twatter</a> or from Discord.</p>
   <p>Or just any social media platform.</p>

   <br> 

    <p>I'm also a bit of a gamer, currently I'm grinding Minecraft. I decided to make this site because I needed a place to release my thoughts without</p>
    <p>getting destroyed by random kids in places.</p>
    
    <p>So, what you have come across is my blog's index page! You could call it an introduction page too.</p>
    <p>If you haven't realized yet, this also is a <b>minimal site</b>. Not very pretty, but works well for my case!</p>
